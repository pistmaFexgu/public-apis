### Hum Tum: A Comparison with When Harry Met Sally
 
Hum Tum is often compared with the 1989 Hollywood film When Harry Met Sally, which also follows the relationship between two people who meet on a flight and keep running into each other over the years. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as Harry and Sally, who debate whether men and women can be friends without sex getting in the way.
 
While there are some similarities between the two films, such as the use of split-screen, interviews with couples and a climactic New Year's Eve scene, Hum Tum is not a mere copy of When Harry Met Sally. Hum Tum has its own identity and charm, and adapts the story to suit the Indian context and culture. Hum Tum also explores some themes that are not present in When Harry Met Sally, such as widowhood, remarriage and parenthood.
 
Hum Tum and When Harry Met Sally are both excellent films that showcase the genre of romantic comedy at its best. They both have engaging characters, witty dialogues, catchy songs and heartwarming moments. They both have a universal appeal that transcends time and place. They both are films that you will love to watch with your partner or your friends.

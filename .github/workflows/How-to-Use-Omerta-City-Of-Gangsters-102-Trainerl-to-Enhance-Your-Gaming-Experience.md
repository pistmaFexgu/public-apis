If you are new to Omerta City of Gangsters, you may need some tips and tricks to master the game's mechanics and strategies. Here are some of the most important ones:
  
## Choose your character wisely
  
At the beginning of the game, you can choose from four different characters, each with their own backstory, skills, and perks. You can also customize your character's appearance and name. Your character will be your main gangster in the game, and will have a significant impact on your gameplay style and options. Therefore, you should choose a character that suits your preferences and goals.
  
## Manage your resources carefully
  
The game revolves around managing four main resources: beer, firearms, dirty money, and clean money. You need beer and firearms to recruit and equip your gangsters, dirty money to buy buildings and bribe officials, and clean money to pay taxes and upgrade your buildings. You can obtain these resources by completing missions, extorting businesses, laundering money, or trading with other gangs. However, you should also be careful not to run out of them, as they are limited and can affect your reputation and income.
  
## Expand your territory strategically
  
The game is divided into several districts, each with its own map, buildings, businesses, gangs, and events. You can expand your territory by buying or taking over buildings in different districts. However, you should also consider the benefits and risks of each district, as some of them may offer more opportunities or challenges than others. For example, some districts may have more profitable businesses or loyal customers, while others may have more rival gangs or police presence. You should also balance your expansion with your defense, as you may need to protect your buildings from attacks or raids.
